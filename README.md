Codename-one
============

Create admin user, in rails console:
  AdminUser.create email: 'admin@example.com', password: 'password', password_confirmation: 'password'

### Code rules:
- Use new syntax whenever you are able to.
- Don't leave commented out code.
- Remember about tests! (describe cases using 3rd person - not 'should'!)
- Single quotes > double quotes
- Always put new line at the end of file
- No trailing spaces!
- Use draper and decent_exposure
