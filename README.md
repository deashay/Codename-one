Codename-one
============

Create admin user, in rails console:
  > AdminUser.create(email: 'admin@example.com', password: 'password', password_confirmation: 'password')

### Global rules:
- Write tests for every method
- Aim for 100% test coverage

### Pivotal Tracker:
- Don't accept stories you've delivered
- Before accepting any story talk about it with other collaborators
- Never accept story which doesn't contain specs

### Code rules:
- Use new syntax whenever you are able to.
- Don't leave commented out code.
- Remember about tests! (describe cases using 3rd person - not 'should'!)
- Single quotes > double quotes.
- Always put new line at the end of file.
- No trailing spaces!
- Use draper and decent_exposure.
- Rails helpers are banned.
